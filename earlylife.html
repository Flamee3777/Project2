            <h2>Future's Early Life</h2>
            <p>Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn[13] was born on November 20, 1983,[13][14] in Atlanta, Georgia.[15][16][17] He attended Columbia High School in Decatur. At age sixteen (c. 1999/2000), Future describes getting shot in the hand and robbed, an event he regards as a major turning point in his life.[18]

                Future began his career under the name "Meathead", as a member of the Georgia-based musical collective Dungeon Family. He was led to join the group by his first cousin Rico Wade (b. 1972 â€“ d. 2024), who was part of the group's in-house production team Organized Noize and operated the East Point, Georgia "Dungeon" studio which the collective's name was based from.[19][20][21][22] Future performed in a smaller hip hop group within the collective who went by the name "Da Connect", where he would later be nicknamed "The Future" by group member G-Rock. Da Connect recorded one album, Rico Wade Presents: Da Connect which was slated for commercial release in 2003, but was ultimately shelved.[23] Future had one solo record on the project titled "Belly of da Beast", which is considered to be his first song.[24][25] During this time, Future appeared in numerous Dungeon Family music videos,[26] and received his first songwriting credit on the Organized Noize-produced single, "Blueberry Yum Yum" for rapper Ludacris in 2004.</p>
